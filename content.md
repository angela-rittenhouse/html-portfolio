## About Dapur Kwee

We are just a small to-go food family business own by a traditional mom who loves cooking and baking for her family who loves to eat. It's all started friends and families are curious to know what cooking for the day. So instead of me sending texts to each one of them they can find me in Instagram under dapurkwee. It all started with just making little dishes but then it grows to baking as well. Once again you can find all the menus either in instagram dapurkwee or www.dapurkwee.com
